This annual reviewing has been over an extremely long time after the Lunar New Year's Eve.

Leaving it to sink or swim seems to be an inevitable option owing to my extreamly lacking excutive power.

It is not my identified style to blame things on objective surroundings.

But there is no doubt that 2019 is a bullshit year, which is stuffed with failure, sorrow, parting and disappointment.

Although it is too late to realize that I made a bad decision on 28th,Sep 2018, or the results have been determined since I decide to come back to Jiangnan Area.

I‘ve never been welcomed in this land in my whole life, despite its richness and abundance in opportunities. I seemd to forget that how brilliant and hypocritical the people it raised and fed, and how uncomfortable I was to live on this land, where its people treated me with no repect and
no equality.

I've tried my whole life to lift up my class and earn repect from peers, teachers, relatives and even parents. And it seems that my only worthness of affirmation is my hardwork. No one cares about who I am, what I have been through and what I was thinking that it is a political rightness for them to treat me like that.

I should have known that I am an evictor of my hometown and I shall never return.

I don't like south-western China, people are rural, peasants are violent, society are lazy. Howerver I had my happiest 4 years there with abundant of friends and achievements. I did almost every thing I wished for ----- a good CET grade, a national scholarship, a NO.1 of my profession for once, some couples of friends I can turn to for my entire life and a good undergraduate school. I was tough, I worked hard, I treat people with respect and friendness and they as well.

So I still can't figure out what is happenning here since I came back to this eastern land. I worked hard and learned humbly but no one recognize my effort; I treated my fellows like bofore but they treated me with disrecpect, dishonesty and selfishness; I clearly understand the difficulties but I can't focus and wonder the meaning behind all of this.

No one would help a weak man. It is a nominal civilization here. I am condemed and bound to rot. Fellows just want to beat me up and consume my flesh, tutors only want to squeeze my worthness, friends purely want to mock me and use me, parents just care about there own and throwing stones when I was under the well.

My life is a game that doomed to lose. I can't figure out any solution to promote my current situation. My allies are rare and unreliable, my enemies are cruel and ruthless， my power is weak and fragile, my situation is helpless and miserable.

I did shall pick up my effort, but it is useless.

I did shall make over with my fellows, but it only gives them another chance to use me.

I did shall do more jobs to earn my resources from my tutor, but he has little to give me anyway.

I did shall be more dependent from my looser parents but it won't work out in Confusious China.

There is no hope, no hope for me at all.
